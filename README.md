# 100 days of code - dotnet 20th anniversary edition

A super simple repo to share for 100 days something I learned about the .net platform. This year is the *20th birthday of .net* and this would be my little contribution to this amazing platform that I've loved since forever.       
This idea born from this project https://www.100daysofx.com/ and in particular from https://www.100daysofcode.com/.
I hope that what I learn and share every day could be interesting for you and for your daily work.
